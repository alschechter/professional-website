Hello! I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work on identifying galaxy mergers with Convolutional Neural Networks, and discovering what effects these mergers have on active galactic nuclei and star formation. I currently use the IllustrisTNG simulation and the _HST_ CANDELS survey to do this work.

## Undergraduate Education

I attended the University of Texas at Austin for my BS in Astronomy, Honors, and BS in Physics. I was a Dean's Honored Graduate and graduated with Distinctions in Research and Servce & Leadership. While at UT, I had the incredible opportunity to work with Prof. Caitlin Casey on dusty, star forming galaxies, as well as participate in the Freshman Research Initiative studying white dwarf stars.

## Outreach and Volunteering

I spent two years volunteering at Fiske Platetarium as part of the Science Under the Dome team. I produced shows given by other graduate students. It was a great way to develop public speaking and science communication skills. In undergrad, I was Outreach Coordinator and President for the Undergraduate Women in Physics and a Mentor in the Women in Natural Sciences Program. Outside of Astronomy, I volunteer at an Equine Therapy barn.
