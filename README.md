Hello! I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work on identifying galaxy mergers with Convolutional Neural Networks, and discovering what effects these mergers have on active galactic nuclei and star formation. I currently use the IllustrisTNG simulation and the _HST_ CANDELS survey to do this work.
